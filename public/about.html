<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Neha Hasan. I am currently 22 years old studying philosophy at the University of Dhaka.
  I have always been enthusiastic about coding and now that i have finally started learning web 
  developing with Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy, I hope that I would be able to keep my journey up and finally reach my goal. 
  I just want to build. </p>

<p>I might be a little narcissistic but it gives me confidence. No matter how much time it might take me, i will always
  prioritize my customer's needs and do my job whole heartedly. After web developing, I plan to learn Python, Java script 
  and cyber security as tech is the only career path where degree has no value and skill has all the value in the world. 
</p>

<p>If now I start talking about my hobbies, the first spot would go to music. I love playing guitar and keybaord though
  my voice is not good and i am not a master at any instrument either. I just love playing that's all. Then comes Chess and
  card magic. I love to do a million things really, but customer support is my priority as I have mentioned before.
</p>
